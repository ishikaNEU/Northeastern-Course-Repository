# Project Description: 

The goal of this project is to create a database containing all relevant resources. The resources database will include: 

Programs offered on the Boston campus of Northeastern University in the College of Engineering, and details about their duration, offerings, and specializations. 
The relevant study material (paid and free resources) for all courses offered by COE. 
Tools and software required by the courses.  
Program contacts (Professors/Advisors/Current Teaching Assistants). 
Future career outcomes post-degree completion. 

We aspire to help learners through our initiative by helping them collate the resources they need to navigate their course. 

Questions that the database should answer: 

1. What are the programs offered by the College of Engineering? 
2. Which courses are covered under each program? 
3. What is the duration of these programs?
4. What are the program’s learning outcomes?
5. What are the specializations/concentrations available in every program?
6. What are the resources/videos, practice, and study material(books, articles, websites) available for a particular course? 
7. Which resources are free and which are paid?
8. What are the tools/IDEs needed to practice? How to find and download these? 
9. Who can I contact to learn more about this program? 
10. What are the career paths and opportunities available after program completion?

# Strategy:

We are planning to web scrape the NEU’s website and other educational platforms extensively to gather data. 
We would research and conduct surveys to collate the best fit for our database. 
We would be then using the above information to create the resources database for any particular course offerings. 

# Outcome:

A consolidated resource repository as a database that is publicly available on GitHub. This will include documentation on how to use the database and a detailed walkthrough by the end of the project.
